# üìä Telemetry Dashboard with Todo App Integration

A comprehensive telemetry visualization dashboard that enables real-time monitoring and analysis of system metrics and logs, integrated with a Todo application for demonstration purposes.

## üéØ Overview

This project combines a powerful telemetry dashboard with a sample Todo application to showcase real-world monitoring capabilities. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Telemetry Dashboard**: A Streamlit-based dashboard providing real-time insights into system performance
2. **Collector Service**: A FastAPI service that collects and processes telemetry data
3. **Todo Application**: A sample Flask application demonstrating real-world monitoring integration
